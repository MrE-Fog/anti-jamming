Abstract of the paper: 

The power allocation of a secondary user (SU) in a
cognitive radio network (CRN) contending with a smart jammer
(JA) is formulated as a zero-sum game, in which the SU as the
leader first chooses the transmit power while JA as the follower
selects jamming power to interrupt the transmission of the SU.
The impact of the cumulative interference constraint for ensuring
PU’s quality of service (QoS) is investigated. A Stackelberg
equilibrium of the anti-jamming CRN game is derived and the
conditions assuring its existence are provided.


How to use this simulation code package?

demoFig2ICCE2018.m can figure out fig2 in [1]


Need to note:For uploading the paper to IEEE ICCE-taiwan,there exists a problem,i.e., 'Font Helvetica is not embedded'
this problem is from matlab figure, to solve it, you need to:
1.download the software 'Notepad++', then using it to edit the 'eps' fig file, by  replacing all the 'Helvetica' word into 'Arial'.
2. The the new eps figure will leave off the 'embedded' problem.

Enjoy the reproducible research!
